# Extension modes and layout

A mode describes workbench context and the docked regions it supports. A page declares its base mode, so page navigation always selects the correct mode.

Use `definePlacement` only for content that should remain across pages in that mode:

```ts
definePlacement({
  id: "sessions",
  mode: workbenchModes.project,
  item: { kind: "view", view: sessions.ref, presence: "open" },
  region: "side",
});
```

A placement can show a static view or bind a resource kind to a view. A static item declares `presence`: `fixed` (always open, not closable), `open` (open until the user closes it), or `closed` (opened from the Add panel). A binding item declares `cardinality` (`one` rebinds a single instance, `many` opens one instance per resource) and an optional `add` action for the Add panel. A placement may also declare `order` and `movableTo`. Region size and collapsibility belong to the mode's `regionSettings`, not to placements. Region choices are `main`, `secondary`, and `side`; navigation belongs in the shared Sidenav tree.

Use `definePage` for routed content. Do not model a page as a mode placement, and do not switch a mode as a separate navigation step. A page target activates the page and its declared mode as one transaction.

Mode and page placements are additive. If both use `side`, both appear. Leaving the page removes only the page placement. User open state is stored against the complete owner identity and cannot leak into another page or mode.
