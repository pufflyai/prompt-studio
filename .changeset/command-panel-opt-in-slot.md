Move the dashboard command palette to opt-in via a new `projectSlots.commandPanel` menu slot. Extensions now choose which commands to surface in the palette by listing them under `menus`, mirroring how header buttons already work. Drops the prior `commandPanel: boolean | object` field on `CommandDefinition`, the `CommandPanelContribution` interface, and the `excludeFromPalette` record field that was opt-out.
