Add `saveTicket` SDK plugin helper that persists a local ticket file, its attachments, and artifacts via the client, mirroring `pstdio tickets save`. Use it from plugin hooks or actions to upload ticket edits from a worktree. The bundled code-review lifecycle plugin template now calls `saveTicket` on review-ready transitions so ticket edits and generated artifacts are persisted before the review session starts.
