Render the project settings skill viewer with a file tree (icons + folders) and move the skill title and description above the editor so they align with its width. On startup, also auto-sync existing project skills that still hold a single SKILL.md file with the latest bundled multi-file skill (when the SKILL.md content is unchanged), and reinstall them to repos.
